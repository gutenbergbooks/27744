may appear very unaccountable, and
whimsical; when I assure you, my Design
is fairly to lay before you all the
Criticisms, as far as I can remember
them, that I have heard on your History of <i>Clarissa</i>;
from the Appearance of the two first Volumes,
to the Close of the Work. I have not willingly
omitted any one Objection I have heard made
to your favourite Character, from her first Appearance
in the World; nor, on the contrary, have I
either diminished or added to the favourable Construction
put on her Words or Actions. If the
Grounds for the Objections are found to be deducible
from the Story, I would have them remain in
their full Force; but if the Answers her Admirers
have given to those Objections are found to result
from an impartial and attentive perusal of the Story,
I would not have her deny'd the Justice they have
done her. But tho' I seem here to speak only of
<i>Clarissa</i>, as she is your principal Character, yet I intend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
as well to take notice of what has been said relating
to your whole Story, as to her in particular.</p>

<p>In the first Conversation I heard on this Subject,
the whole Book was unanimously condemned, without
the least Glimpse of Favour from any one present
who sat in judgment on it. It was tedious
stuff!&mdash;low!&mdash;Letters wrote between Misses about
their Sweet-hearts!&mdash;There was an Uncle <i>Anthony</i>&mdash;a
Brother <i>James</i>!&mdash;a Goody <i>Norton</i>!&mdash;and a Servant
<i>Hannah</i>.&mdash;In short, <i>one</i> had no Patience to
read it, <i>another</i> could not bear it, a <i>third</i> did not
like it, <i>&amp;c.</i> Such general Censurers, I knew, could
be very little worth attending to; and this Judgment
I should have formed had I been a Stranger
to the Book thus unmercifully treated; but as I had
read <i>Clarissa</i>, and observed some Beauties in it, yet
heard not one of them mentioned, I was determined
to say nothing, and to make my Visit as short as
possible.</p>

<p>From hence I went to spend the Evening with a
Family in whose Conversation I am always agreeably
entertained. There happened, that Night, to be a
pretty large Assembly of mix'd Company. <i>Clarissa</i>
immediately became the Subject of our Conversation,
when, after a few general Remarks, one of the
Gentlemen said, "His chief Objection was to the
Length of it, for that he was certain he could tell
the whole Story contained in the two first Volumes
in a few Minutes; for Example, (continued he)
There is a Family who live in the Country, consisting
of an old, positive, gouty Gentleman, two
old Batchelors as positive as their gouty Brother,
a meek Wife, an ambitious Son, an envious elder
Sister, and a handsome younger Sister; who,
having refused many offered Matches, engages
the Attention and Liking of one Mr. <i>Lovelace</i>, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>young Gentleman of a noble Family; her Brother
has an absolute Aversion to him; a Rencounter
follows between them; the Lady corresponds
with <i>Lovelace</i> to prevent farther Mischief; a disagreeable
Man is proposed to her by all her Family;
she will not consent; they all combine to
insist on her Compliance; she is lock'd up; forbid
all Correspondence out of the Family, but still
persists in her Refusal; they call it Obstinacy; she
calls it Resolution; Mr. <i>Lovelace</i> takes the Advantage
of her Friends cruel Usage of her, and presses
her to throw herself on his Protection: at last,
for fear of being forced to marry the Man she
hates, she appoints to go off with <i>Lovelace</i>; but
fearing the Consequence of such a rash Step, and
thinking it a Breach of her Duty to leave her Father's
House till urged by the last Necessity, she
would have retracted the Appointment, and
waited yet a little longer, in hopes her Friends
might be influenced to change their Mind; Mr.
<i>Lovelace</i> does not take the Letter she puts in the
usual Place for that purpose, and we see by her
last Letter to her Friend, dated at St. <i>Albans</i>, that
she is there with <i>Lovelace</i>. Now, how is it possible
for this Story, without being exceeding tedious,
to be spun out to two Volumes, containing
each above 300 Pages?"</p>

<p>When the Gentleman ceased, a young Lady,
whose Name was <i>Gibson</i>, took a little Almanack out
of her Pocket, and, turning to the Place where the
Births and Deaths of the Kings of <i>England</i> were
marked, gave it to the Gentleman, and said, "that
by his Rule of Writing, that was the best History
of <i>England</i>, and Almanack-makers were the best
Historians".</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Johnson</i>, another of the Company, said, he
would engage to relate the <i>Roman</i> History, in that
manner, in as little time as had been expended in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
summing up the Story of <i>Clarissa</i>; and then, with a
Monotony in his Voice that expressed more Humour
than I can describe, he began as follows:</p>

<p>"<i>Romulus</i> the Son of <i>Apulius</i>, as some say, tho'
according to others the Son of <i>Mars</i> by one of the
Vestal Virgins, built the City of <i>Rome</i>, and reign'd
there 37 Years; after him reigned six Kings successively
(their Names are of no Consequence)
but the Wickedness of the last King put an end
to the regal State, and introduced the Consular,
which we may say lasted about the Space of
427 Years, tho' it was retrenched in Power by
the Tribunes of the People, and had many Intermissions
by the Creation of Dictators, the Decemviri,
and the military Tribuns; during all
this time, sometimes there was War, sometimes
there was Peace, foreign Wars in abundance,
great Civil Wars, not a few Contentions for
Power amongst all Degrees of Men, vast Conquests,
great Extent or Empire, till at last, in the
famous Plains of <i>Pharsalia</i>, was fought a decisive
Battel for the Empire, between two ambitious
Men, namely, <i>Cæsar</i> and <i>Pompey</i>; the latter fled,
and was treacherously slain on the <i>Egyptian</i> Shore,
whilst the former remain'd Master of the Field,
and almost of the Universe."</p>

<p>Here Mr. <i>Johnson</i> changed the Tone of his Voice,
and said, "I will pursue this no farther, for to the
Death of <i>Pompey</i> makes twenty Volumes in the
History wrote by the Fathers <a name="candr" id="candr"></a><i>Catrou</i> and <i>Rouillé</i>,
which is generally allowed to be a very good one,
and, I think, one of its chief Beauties depends on the
Length; for to that we owe the displaying so many
various Characters, and the diving into the Motives
of those great Mens Actions, who guided
that extensive, powerful, I had almost said unmanagable
Common-wealth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Singleton</i> laugh'd, and said, "He was surprised
to hear a Man of Mr. <i>Johnson's</i> Understanding
display so much Eloquence to prove, (if
he intended to prove any thing by it) that the
knowing the Particulars of the Family at <i>Harlow-place</i>
was of as much Consequence, as the knowing
the Springs and Wheels on which turned the
Affairs of the greatest Commonwealth that was
ever heard of since the Creation of the World.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Sir, replied the Lady of the House, (who
has bred up three Sons and three Daughters, who do
Honour to her Education of them) I really think
the penetrating into the Motives that actuate the Persons
in a private Family, of much more general use
to be known, than those concerning the Management
of any Kingdom or Empire whatsoever:
The latter, Princes, Governors, and Politicians only
can be the better for, whilst every Parent, every
Child, every Sister, and every Brother, are concerned
in the former, and may take example by
such who are in the same Situation with themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Clark</i> said, "that he believed the whole Account
of the Mind of Man, were we only to mention
the primary Passions, might be comprised in
a few Words; but (continued he) from those
Fountains to trace the several Channels into which
they flow, and to get a Clue to guide us through
all the winding Labyrinths into which they turn
themselves, is no such easy Matter; that</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
<i>Life's but a walking Shadow, a poor Player,<br />
That struts and frets his Hour upon the Stage<br />
And then is heard no more,</i><br />
</div></div>

<p>perhaps gives us as strong an Image as it is possible
to receive, of all the great Transactions perform'd
by Mankind for these 6000 Years; and yet the
celebrated Author, who wrote those Words, has
diversify'd and display'd that strutting and fret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>ting
in as many various Lights as he has drawn
Characters throughout his immortal Writings.</p>

<p>"In these two Volumes of <i>Clarissa</i>, it plainly
appears, the Author's Intention is to impress
deeply on the Reader's Mind, the peculiar Character
of each Person in that Family whence his
Heroine is derived; and in this I think he has
succeeded so well, that for my own part I am as
intimately acquainted with all the <i>Harlows</i>, as if I
had known them from my Infancy; and if I
was to receive a Letter from any one of them, I
am sure I should not want the Name to assist
me in assigning it to the proper Person. Tho',
upon the whole, I don't know but there may
be some Exuberances that might have been spared,
as they stop the Progress of the Story, and keep
us in anxious doubt concerning <i>Clarissa's</i> Fate,
altho' the scattered Observations have generally
the Recommendation of Novelty to amuse the
Curious, Depth to engage the Attention of the
Considerate, and Sprightliness to entertain the
Lively; and Story is considered by the Author,
as he says in his Preface, but as the Vehicle to
convey the more necessary Instruction. And
<i>Clarissa</i> says to Miss <i>How</i>;</p>

<div class="blockquote"><i>You will always have me give you minute Descriptions,
nor suffer me to pass by the Air and Manner
in which Things are spoken, that are to be taken
notice of; rightly observing, that Air and Manner
often express more than the accompanying Words.</i></div>

<p>"If this Observation is just, and Air and Manner
can be placed before a Reader's View by writing,
I am sure minute Descriptions are necessary;
and I could point out several Places in <i>Clarissa</i>,
where we may see the very Look of the Eyes,
and Turn of the Countenance of the Persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
mentioned, and hear the Tone of the Voice
of the Person speaking."</p>

<p>The next Objection was raised by Mr. <i>Dobson</i>,
to Mrs. <i>Harlowe's</i> Character, which he said, "It
was plain you did not intend as a bad one, by
her Meekness, Submission to her Husband, and
her hitherto truly maternal Care of her Family;
and yet, when she joins with violent overbearing
Spirits, to oppress and persecute such a Daughter
as <i>Clarissa</i>, because she steadily adhered to a
Resolution of refusing solemnly to vow at the
Altar Love and Obedience to such a Wretch as
<i>Solmes</i>, what was this but Tameness and Folly
instead of Meekness?"</p>

<p>Totally to justify Mrs. <i>Harlowe</i> was not attempted;
on the contrary, it was unanimously agreed,
that she was to blame: But Miss <i>Gibson</i> desired
"Mrs. <i>Harlow's</i> Faults might not be thrown on
the Author, unless it could be proved that he
himself intended her Conduct should deserve no
Censure. However, (continued she) to preserve
any Charity in censuring her, I think it should
be considered, how much a Woman must be
embarassed, who has for many Years accustomed
herself to obey the very Looks of another, where
a Point is peremptorily insisted on, which, to
comply with, must gall her to the Heart. Mrs.
<i>Harlowe</i> might indeed have suffered with <i>Clarissa</i>,
but could not have preserved her from her Father's
Fury, irritated and inflamed by her ambitious
violent Brother: And perhaps she flatter'd
herself, that she might gain more Influence
by seeming to comply, than if she had attempted
absolutely to resist the Storm gathering
in her Family. And this I think, the many
Hints she gives, that if she was left to herself,
it would be otherwise, is a full Proof of."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>A young Lady, who had hitherto been silent,
looked pleased at Miss <i>Gibson's</i> Remarks, and said;</p>

<p>"I think <i>Clarissa</i> herself has made very good
Observations on her Mamma's Meekness, and the
Effects of it, in one of her Letters to Miss
<i>Howe</i>, where she says&mdash;In my Mamma's Case, your
Observation is verifyed, that those who will bear
much, shall have much to bear. And how true is her
farther Observation, where she says, that she fears
her Mamma has lost that very Peace which she has
sacrificed so much to obtain."</p>

<p>"Your Remark, Madam, said Miss <i>Gibson</i>, is
very just, and from this Character of Mrs. <i>Harlowe</i>,
we may draw a noble and most useful
Moral; for as in the Body, too rich Blood occasions
many Diseases, so in the Mind, the very
Virtues themselves, if not carefully watched,
may produce very hurtful Maladies. Meekness
therefore, and a long Habit of Submission, is
often accompanied by a want of Resolution, even
where Resolution is commendable. To be all
Softness, Gentleness and Meekness, and at the
same time to be steadily fixed in every Point 'tis
improper to give up, is peculiar to <i>Clarissa</i> herself,
and a Disposition of Mind judiciously reserved
by the Author for his Heroine alone."</p>

<p>An old Gentleman who sat in the Corner, and
often made wry Faces at the sudden Attack of
Rheumatick Pains, with which he was often afflicted,
objected strongly to Mr. <i>Harlowe's</i> arbitrary Usage
of such a Wife, as being very unnatural. "Nay,
Sir, (said Miss <i>Gibson</i>) I think <i>Clarissa</i> gives a
very good Account of Mr. <i>Harlowe's</i> Behaviour,
in a Letter to her Friend, when she says;</p>

<div class="blockquote"><i>But my Father was soured by the cruel Distemper
I have named, which seized him all at once,
in the very prime of Life, in so violent a Manner,
as to take from the most active Mind, as HIS
was, all Power of Activity, and that in all Appearance
for Life.&mdash;It imprison'd, as I may say,
his lively Spirits in himself and turned the Edge
of them against his own Peace, his extraordinary
Prosperity adding but to his Impatiency.</i></div>

<p>"And methinks, it is very easy to imagine, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<i>Harlowe's</i> Pains, and Mrs. <i>Harlowe's</i> tender Concern
for these Pains increasing together: her Attention
to him, and earnest Endeavours to soften
and alleviate the Extremity of his Torments
becoming all her Care; till, his Ill-temper daily
growing stronger by the Force of his bodily
Disorders, he at last habituated himself to vent
it on the Person who most patiently submitted,
tho' her Heart was most nearly touched and affected
by it. And I appeal to the common Experience
of any Persons who have accustomed
themselves to make Observations on the Scenes
before them, if they have not often seen heart-breaking
Harshness burst forth on those who
strongest feel the Strokes, and yet submit to them
without complaining; and this practised even by
Persons who would take it much amiss to be
thought peculiarly ill-natured."</p>

<p>The old Gentleman, without answering Miss
<i>Gibson</i>, insisted on what he had said before; and
then turning to his Daughter, in a rough Voice, accompanied
with a fierce Look, bid her not sit
so idly, but ring the Bell, that the Servant might
get a Coach, for he would go home. The young
Lady, who was as submissive a Daughter as Mrs.
<i>Harlow</i> was a Wife, immediately obeyed his Commands,
tho' it might be read in her Countenance,
that she could have wished that he would have injoined
them in a milder Manner; on which her
Father observed, that the Girl was always out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Humour and sullen when she was employed. Indeed,
Sir, said the young Lady, I love to be
honoured with your Commands; I was only afraid
you was angry with me. A Tear stole without her
Consent from her Eyes, and at the same Time she
looked at her Father with a supplicating, instead of
a sullen Countenance.</p>

<p>As soon as the Coach came, the old Gentleman,
with great Roughness, commanded his Daughter to
attend him, and left us; and we could not help
remarking, how much the Gentleman's Behaviour
had added Weight to the Force of his Criticism.</p>

<p>The next Objection was raised by Mr. <i>Dellincourt</i>,
who found great Fault with the Liberties you have
taken with the <i>English</i> Language, and said, you
had coined new Words, and printed others as if
you was writing a Spelling-book, instead of relating
a Story. We were all silent for a few Moments,
and then Miss <i>Gibson</i> said;</p>

<p>"Indeed, Sir, I do not pretend to be any Judge
of the Accuracy of Stile, but I beg to know, if
in the writing familiar Letters, many Liberties
are not allowable, which in other kinds of writing
might perhaps be justly condemned: And
as to the printing some of the Words with Breaks
between the Syllables, it certainly <a name="make" id="make"></a>makes the
Painting the stronger; however, I submit this
entirely to the Judgment of others. But supposing
this to be a failing, surely it is a trifling one,
to censure a Book severely for, in which there are
so many striking Beauties to be found. But to
illustrate my Thoughts on this Head, I will tell
you a Story that is really true.</p>

<p>"A Gentleman shewed a Friend of his a Picture
of a favourite Horse, drawn by the celebrated
Mr. <i>Wooten</i>. The Horse was unexceptionably beautiful,
and the Picture excellently drawn. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Friend regarded it for some Time with great Attention:
When the Gentleman (who was a Lover
of Pictures, and who delighted to share his Pleasures
with others) earnestly asked his Friend's
Opinion of the Piece he was viewing; who,
after much Consideration, with a significant
Shrug of his Shoulders, and a contemptuous Toss
of his Hand, said, <i>I don't like the Skirts of the
Saddle</i>."</p>

<p>The Application of this Story was so very plain,
that the whole Company were diverted with it;
and thus, Sir, I think I have sumed up all the Critisism
I heard either against or in favour of your
<i>Clarissa</i>, on the Publication of the two first Volumes.</p>

<p>The next Scene of Criticism (if I may so call it)
on <i>Clarissa</i> that I was present at, was on the Publication
of the two succeeding Volumes.</p>

<p>The same Company met, with the Addition only
of one Gentleman, whom I shall call <i>Bellario</i>; his
known Taste and Impartiality made all those
who wished Reason instead of Prejudice might
judge of the Subject before them, rejoice at his
Presence. The Objections now arose so fast, it was
impossible to guess where they would end. <i>Clarissa</i>
herself was a Prude&mdash;a Coquet&mdash;all the Contradictions
mentioned some Time ago in a printed
Paper, with the Addition of many more, were laid
to her Charge. She was an undutiful Daughter&mdash;too
strict in her Principles of Obedience to such
Parents&mdash;too fond of a Rake and a Libertine&mdash;her
Heart was as impenitrable and unsusceptible of Affection,
as the hardest Marble. In short, the many
contradictory Faults that she was at once accused of,
is almost incredible: So many, that those who had attended
enough to her Character, to have an Inclination
to justify her, found it difficult to know where to begin
to answer such a complicated Charge. But after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
short Silence, Miss <i>Gibson</i> with her usual Penetration,
said;</p>

<p>"Whenever any Person is accused of a Variety
of Faults, which are plainly impossible to dwell
in the same Mind, I am immediately convinced
the Person so accused is innocent of them all.
A Prude cannot, by an observing Eye, be taken for
a Coquet, nor a Coquet for a Prude, but a good
Woman may be called either, or both, according
to the Dispositions of her resolved Censurers; and
hence I believe we may trace the Cause, why
the Characters even of those Persons who do not
endeavour to wear any Disguise are so very liable
to be mistaken; for Partiality or Prejudice generally
sit as Judges: If the former mount the
Judgment-seat, how many different Terms do we
make use of to express that Goodness in another,
which our own fluctuating Imaginations only have
erected? If the latter, how do we vary Expressions
to paint that Wickedness which we are
resolve to prove inhabits the Mind we think proper
to condemn?" "Nay, but (said Mr. <i>Dellincourt</i>)
how are we concerned either to justify or
accuse <i>Clarissa</i>? we cannot be either partial to, or
prejudised against her." "I know not how it
is, (replyed Miss <i>Gibson</i>) but those who dread
Censure, tho' Circumspection wait on every Step,
will be censured, till there no longer remains in
the World any of those Dispositions that delight
in inflicting that Punishment on others they see
they most fear. Now, tho' <i>Clarissa</i> was not so
blameably fearful of Censure, but that her first
Care was to preserve the Innocence of her own
Mind, and do no wrong; yet it is plain, she
would very gladly have avoided incurring, as
well as deserving, Reproach; and that she is
treated like an intimate Acquaintance by all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Readers, the Author may thank himself for.
I dare say, the Authors of <i>Cassandra</i>, <i>Clelia</i>,
with numberless others I could name, were never
in any Danger of having their Heroines thought
on, or treated like human Creatures."</p>

<p><i>Bellario</i>, who had hitherto been silent, said, "He
thought <i>Clarissa</i> could not justly be accused of
any material Fault, but that of wanting Affection
for her Lover; for that he was sure, a Woman
whose Mind was incapable of Love, could not
be amiable, nor have any of those gentle Qualities
which chiefly adorn the female Character.
And as to her whining after her Papa and Mamma,
who had used her so cruelly, (added he) I think
'tis contemptible in her."</p>

<p>"But, Sir, (said Miss <i>Gibson</i>) please only to consider,
first, <i>Clarissa</i> is accused of want of Love,
and then in a Moment she is condemned for not
being able suddenly to tear from her Bosom an
Affection that had been daily growing and improving
from the Time of her Birth, and this
built on the greatest paternal Indulgence imaginable.
Affections that have taken such deep
Root, are little Treasures hoarded up in the good
Mind, and cannot be torn thence without causing
the strongest convulsive Pangs in the Heart,
where they have been long nourished: And when
they are so very easily given up as you now, Sir,
seem to contend for, I confess I am very apt to
suspect they have only been talked of by the Persons
who can part with them with so little Pain,
either from Hypocrisy, or from another very obvious
Cause, namely, the using Words we are
accustomed to hear, without so much as thinking
of their Meaning. Such Hearts I think may
be much more properly compared to the Hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>ness
of Marble, than could that of the gentle
<i>Clarissa</i>.</p>

<p>"There is in her Behaviour, I own, a good deal
of apparent Indifference to <i>Lovelace</i>; but let her
Situation and his manner of treating her be considered,
and I fancy the whole will be seen in a
different Light from what it may appear on the
first View. She has confessed to Miss <i>Howe</i>, that
she could prefer him to all the Men she ever saw;
and that Friend of her Heart, to whom her very
inmost Thoughts were laid open all along, pronounces
her to be in Love with him. It is not
from Hypocrisy that she does not confess the
Charge, but from the Reason Miss <i>Howe</i> gives,
when she says;</p>

<div class="blockquote"><i>I believe you did not intend Reserve to me, for two
Reasons, I believe you did not; first, because you say
you did not: Next, because you have not as yet been
able to convince yourself how it is to be with you;
and, persecuted as you are, how so to separate the Effects
that spring from the two Causes (Persecution
and Love) as to give to each its particular Due.</i></div>

<p>"That <i>Clarissa</i> positively did not intend to go
off with <i>Lovelace</i> when she met him, to me is
very plain; nor could he have prevailed on her,
had not the Terrors raised in her Mind, by apprehended
Murder, almost robbed her of her Senses,
and hurried her away, not knowing what she
did. For the Truth of this, I appeal to that
charming painted Scene, where the Reader's
Mind shares <i>Clarissa's</i> Terror, and is kept in one
continued Tumult til.</p>

</div></div>

<p>"She was vexed to her soul afterwards to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
she was tricked, as she calls it, out of herself,
when <i>Lovelace</i>, instead of comforting and assuring
her Mind, begins such a Train of shufling artful
Tricks, as no one but <i>Lovelace</i> could have thought
on: And altho' she did not know all his Design,
for if she had, she would certainly have left him,
yet she sees enough of his <i>crooked ways</i>, to be
convinced that he acted ungenerously by her,
because she was in <i>his Power</i>. Does not <i>Lovelace</i>,
in a Letter to <i>Belford</i>, writ in four Days
after she was with him, say?</p>

<div class="blockquote"><i>And do I not see, that I shall want nothing but
Patience, in order to have all Power with me? For
what shall we say, if all these Complaints of a Character
Wounded, these Declarations of increasing Regrets
of meeting me, of Resentments never to be got over
for my seducing her away, these angry Commands <a name="to" id="to">to</a>
leave her,&mdash;what shall we say, if all were to mean
nothing but Matrimony?&mdash;And what if my forbearing
to enter upon that Subject comes out to be the
true Cause of her Petulance and Uneasiness.</i></div>

<p>"And then he gives such an Account of his asking
her Consent to marry him, and at the same
Time artfully confusing her, so as to prevent her
Consent, as perfectly paints his cunning vile
Heart. How is her Behaviour altered to him
from the Time she can write Miss <i>Howe</i> word
that her Prospects are mended, till his returning
Shufling convinces her there is no Confidence
to be placed in him! But if, Sir, you cannot think
<i>Lovelace's</i> Usage of <i>Clarissa</i> a full Justification of
her in this Point, I think the Author has a just
Right to be heard out before his Heroine is condemned
in so heavy a Charge, as that of being
void of all Affection. You know enough of my
Sentiments, Sir, to be convinced that I do think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
this the heaviest Charge a Woman can be accused
of; for Love is the only Passion I should wish to be
harboured in the gentle Bosom of a good Woman.
Ambition, with all the Train of turbulent Passions
the World is infested with, I would leave
to Men: And could I make my whole Sex of my
Opinion, they would be resigned without the least
Grudge or Envy; for Peace and Harmony dwell
not with them, but on the contrary, Discord,
Perturbation and Misery are their constant Companions.
But tho' I speak thus with the utmost
Sincerity of Love; yet I cannot think a Woman
greatly the Object of Esteem who, like <i>Serina</i>
in the <i>Orphan</i>, having such a Father as <i>Acasto</i>, and
such Brothers, affectionate to her, however blameable
in other Respects; while she saw her whole Family
distressed and confused, and <i>Monimia</i>, the gentle
Companion of her Infancy, involved in that Confusion,
her Lover too behaving like a Mad-man,
yet still, could cry out,</p>

<p>"<i>Clarissa</i> would have acted a different Part, I do
confess; and yet, if I can guess any Thing of the
Author's Intention by what is already published,
I fancy, when we have read the Conclusion of
this Story, we shall be convinced that Love was
the strongest Characteristic of <i>Clarissa's</i> Mind."</p>

<p><i>Bellario</i> answered, with that Candor, which is
known to be one of the most distinguishing Marks
of his Character by all who have the Pleasure of
his Acquaintance, 'That if it proved so, he should
have the greatest Esteem and highest Veneration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
for <i>Clarissa</i>, and would suspend his Judgment till
he saw the remaining Part of the Story.'</p>

<p>But all the Company were not so candid, for
Mr. <i>Dellincourt</i> said, 'He was sure <i>Clarissa</i> could
not in the remaining Part of the Story convince
him, that her Characteristic was Love; for nothing
less than the lovely <i>Emma's</i> Passion for
<i>Henry</i> would be any Satisfaction to him, if he
was a Lover.'&mdash;Miss <i>Gibson</i> said. 'She had often
been sorry that the Poem of <i>Henry</i> and <i>Emma</i>
had not been long ago buried in Oblivion; for
(continued she) it is one of those Things which,
by the Dress and Ornaments of fine Language
and smooth Poetry, has imposed on Mankind so
strong a Fallacy, as to make a Character in itself
most despicable, nay I may say most blameable,
generally thought worthy Admiration and
Praise: For strip it of the dazzling Beauties
of Poetry, and thus fairly may the Story be
told.</p>

<p>An old <i>English</i> Baron retired in his Decline of
Life to his Country-seat, where one only Daughter
(left him by a Wife he fondly loved) was the Care,
the Joy, the Comfort of his declining Years: No
sooner had the State of blooming Youth taken place of
that of prattling Infancy, than she became the Object
of publick Admiration, and Lovers of all Degrees
with Emulation strove to gain the fair <i>Emma's</i> Favour;
but as yet her Heart was free, and her Father's
paternal tender Indulgence never once endeavoured
to force her Choice. At last the happy <i>Henry</i>
in various Disguises found the means to obtain her
Favour, and she becomes passionately in Love with
him: But not content with this, he resolves on a
Trial of her Constancy, and therefore tells her, that
he is a Murderer, must fly from Justice, and herd
amongst the lowest and basest of Mankind; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
he despised her, and the fond Heart she had given
him; a younger and fairer Nymph now engaging
his Pursuit, and that if she would follow him, she
also must herd with Outlaws his Companions, who
like himself were fled from Justice; where Impiety,
Blasphemy and Obscenity would be all the Language
she could hear.</p>

<p><i>Emma</i> on this Trial, ignorant who <i>Henry</i> was,
or what Brothel had last given him up, without
one Enquiry whether the Murder he confessed was
not of the blackest Die, remorseless for all the Agonies
with which she must tear her Father's tender
Bosom, resolves at all Events, as <i>Henry</i> himself
says,</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
<i>Name, Habit, Parents, Woman, left behind</i>.
</div></div>

<p>to follow him through the World; not admitted to
share his Fate, but to be scorned and insulted by him.
Thus <i>victoriously</i> she stood her Trial. <i>Henry</i> turns
out a great Man; consequently his Wife is greatly
admired; Success crowns all, and both Grandeur
and Love join to reward her supposed heroic
Virtue.</p>

<p>But had the Poet thought proper, that <i>Henry</i>
should have turned out the Murderer, the Vagabond,
the insolent and ungrateful Scorner of her
Love he represented himself to be; had her Father's
Sorrow for her Fate shortned his miserable Days;
had she been abandoned by the Wretch she had so
much Reason to expect the worst of Treatment from,
and, between Rage, Despair, and a thousand conflicting
Passions, been led by a natural Gradation
from one Vice to another, till she had been lost in
the most abandoned Profligacy; instead of being
proposed for an Example, her Name would have
been only mentioned to deter others from the like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
rash Steps. That this was the natural Consequence
of her Actions is very apparent: Nor do I think
from her Behaviour, that <i>Henry</i> had the least Reason
to be convinced that she would not leave him for
the first Man who would try to seduce her, provided
the Colour of his Complexion suited her Fancy.</p>

<p>All the Company were very inclineable to yield up
<i>Emma's</i> Cause, if <i>Henry had</i> indeed been a Villain
and a Murderer; only great Part of them were very
apt to forget one Circumstance, namely, that it was
impossible for her to know, but that he was the
Wretch he represented himself to be; and Miss <i>Gibson</i>
seemed to be much more inclined to compassionate
her, if extreme Misery had been her Fate, than
was the Gentleman who first mentioned her as an
Object of Admiration, only because the Author of
the Poem thought fit to reward her. Miss <i>Gibson</i>
then addressing herself to <i>Bellario</i>, said, 'Sir, you
are a Father,&mdash;an indulgent Father,&mdash;would you
have your Daughter act in such a Manner?&mdash;<i>Bellario</i>
honestly owned he would not. 'Why then,
Sir, (replyed she) please to consider a Moment,
and you will see the Injustice of wishing another
Man's Daughter should act so.' <i>Bellario</i> ingenuously
confessed, that when he read the Poem of <i>Henry</i> and
<i>Emma</i>, the Picture of his Mistress, and not that of
his Daughter, was before his Eyes, and he would
have his Mistress <i>of all Mankind love but him
alone</i>.&mdash;&mdash;'I wonder not at that, Sir, (said Miss
<i>Gibson</i>) but then you would not be the Man <i>Henry</i>
represented himself to be. Had <i>Henry</i> had any
Misfortunes by which his Heart had not been
stained.</p>

</div></div>

<p>no one would more have applauded <i>Emma's</i> Resolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
<i>of loving of all Mankind but him alone</i>, than
I should have done: But yet when I see a Woman
seriously endeavour to conquer a Passion for a
Man who proves himself unworthy her Love, it will
always be to me a strong Proof of her steady Constancy
to a Man she has Reason to esteem. I
would have had <i>Emma</i> stood <i>Henry's</i> shocking
Tryal as <i>Macduff</i> in <a name="the" id="the"></a>the Tragedy of <i>Macbeth</i>
does that of <i>Malcolm</i>, and when he had proved
himself unworthy her least Affection; I think, in
the Words of <i>Macduff</i> she might have said,</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
<i>&mdash;&mdash;Fare thee well,<br />
These Evils thou repeat'st upon thyself,<br />
Have banish'd me from</i> <span class="smcap">Joy</span>.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Oh! my Breast,<br />
Thy Hope ends here.</i><br />
</div></div>

<p>On such a Behaviour, I think the Reward she met
with should have been founded, and such I believe
would have been the Behaviour of <i>Clarissa</i> in the
like Circumstances.</p>

<p>'The Love that is not judicious, must be as uncertain
as its capricious Foundation: But 'tis one
of the distinguishing Marks of <i>Clarissa's</i> Character,
to watch her own Mind, that Prejudice may not
get Possession of it, nor her Imagination run away
with her Judgment. With what a noble Contempt
does she treat the extravagant Offers <i>Solmes</i>
makes her, at the Expence of Justice, and cruelly
leaving his Family to starve? But how very few People,
like <i>Clarissa</i>, can poise the Scales with an even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Hand, where one Grain of Self is placed in either
Scale?'</p>

<p>The Gentleman, who had at first started the Objection
to <i>Clarissa</i> of her being incapable of any
strong Affection, now said, 'that he could not see
any Proof of her Impartiality, in that she could
view the Actions of <i>Solmes</i> in the proper Light:
He did not know whether she would have argued
in the same manner With regard to <i>Lovelace</i>'. Miss
<i>Gibson</i> said, 'Do you speak this, Sir, as a Proof of
the Justice of your first Objection to <i>Clarissa</i>, that
her Heart was as impenetrable as Marble; is it reasonable
she should be condemned both ways?' The
Gentleman look'd very grave for a Moment, and
then said, he was sure she had no Affections in her,
notwithstand what he had now said.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Johnson</i> on this, told the following Story.</p>

<p>"I remember (said he) I went some time ago
with Mr. <i>Tonson</i> to a celebrated Painter's, to see
a Picture he had drawn of a Gentleman we were
both intimately acquainted with; the Resemblance
was very strong; we were much pleased
with the Picture, even to the very Drapery; the
Coat was a fine Crimson Cloth, but Mr. <i>Tonson</i>,
at first View, took it for Velvet; he was soon convinced
of his Mistake, but yet could never since
mention the Picture, without talking of the Velvet
Coat; and when I have bid him remember it
was Cloth, he has always acknowledged it, and
said, it's very true Sir; And yet such a strong
Impression had his first Idea of it made in his
Mind, that in two Minutes he could talk again
of the Velvet Coat, with as much Ease as if he
had been perfectly ignorant of his Mistake."</p>

<p>A strong Objection was raised to Mr. <i>Lovelace's</i>
being so long without any Attempt on the Lady's
Honour, when she was under the same Roof with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
him, and so much in his Power. Mr. <i>Johnson</i> said
he thought Mr. <i>Belford</i> had given a good Reason
for this Delay in a Letter to <i>Lovelace</i>, where he says,</p>

<div class="blockquote"><i>Thou too a Man born for Intrigue, full of Invention,
intrepid, remorseless, able patiently to watch for
the Opportunity, not flurried, as most Men, by Gusts of
violent Passion, which often nip a Project in the Bud,
and make the Snail, which was just putting out its
Horns to meet the Inviter, withdraw into its Shell.</i></div>

<p>So that it seems to be a Maxim, amongst <i>Lovelace</i>
and his Club of Rakes, not to destroy their own
Schemes by a too precipitate Pursuit; and <i>Lovelace</i>
gives yet a stronger Reason for it in the following
Words.</p>

<div class="blockquote"><i>O Virtue, Virtue,</i> says he, <i>what is there in thee,
that can thus affect the Heart of such a Man as me
against my Will!&mdash;Whence these involuntary Tremors,
and fear of giving mortal Offence! What art thou
that, acting in the Breast of a feeble Woman, canst
strike so much awe into a Spirit so intrepid which never
before, no, not in my first Attempt, young as I then
was, and frighted at my own Boldness (till I found
myself</i> forgiven,) <i>had such an Effect on me.</i></div>

<p>But Quotations from <i>Lovelace's</i> Words to this
Purpose, and that he was resolved to be slow in order
to be sure, would be endless.</p>

<p>This, I think, was the last Objection raised; only
<i>Bellario</i> said, that the Report that the Catastrophy
was to be unhappy had made a deep Impression on
him; for that he could not avoid thinking that, if it
was true, it must be a great Error, and destroy all
the Pleasure a good-natur'd Reader might already
have received: However, he said, he would keep
his Word in not absolutely giving his Judgment till
he saw the Conclusion.</p>

<p>And thus ended the second Scene of Criticism
on <i>Clarissa</i>; only, as we went down Stairs, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Lady, who had not spoke one Word the whole Evening,
mutter'd out a strong Dislike, that the agreeable
Mr. <i>Lovelace</i> should not become a Husband.</p>

<p>And now, in the Month of <i>December</i>, appears the
long expected, much wished for Conclusion of <i>Clarissa's</i>
Story.</p>

<p>The Company we have already mentioned being
again assembled, the Lady who had before grieved
that the agreeable Mr. <i>Lovelace</i> should not become a
Husband, now lamented that Miss <i>Howe</i> should be
married to so insipid a Man (that was the Epithet she
chose for him) as Mr. <i>Hickman</i>. This passed some
little time without any Answer. Miss <i>Gibson</i> was silent;
and I saw by her Looks that she thought there
was some Weight in her Objection. At last an old
Lady, who had three Daughters marriagable, said,
she wondered to hear Mr. <i>Hickman</i> called insipid;
for she thought there could be no Reason for giving
him that Appellation, unless young Women would
confess what she should be very sorry to hear them
confess, namely, that, in their Opinion, Sobriety intitles
a Man to the Character of Insipidity. Pray remember,
continued the Lady, that there is no Ridicule
cast upon Mr. <i>Hickman</i> throughout the whole
Story, but by <i>Lovelace</i> and Miss <i>Howe</i>. The former
lov'd Ridicule so well, that he could make Objects
of it, by the Help of his gay Imagination, even
where he found none: Besides, he hated any Man
should have a fine Woman but himself; for, in his
Opinion, he alone deserved them. And I think Miss
<i>Howe</i> is very censurable for the Liberties she takes
with a worthy Man, whom also it is plain she intends
to make her Husband.</p>

<p>Miss <i>Gibson</i> agreed in censuring Miss <i>Howe</i> for the
Liberties she takes with him; but at the same time
said, she thought even his bearing that Usage did
lower his Character. Now you see, replied the Lady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
how you are taken in; that you can condemn Miss
<i>Howe</i> for her Contempt of Mr. <i>Hickman</i>, and yet
at the same time let the lively Strokes that fall from
her Pen have their full force against the abused worthy
Man. Yet Miss <i>Howe</i> herself owns, as early as
the second Volume, that Mr. <i>Hickman</i> is humane,
benevolent, generous,&mdash;No Fox-hunter&mdash;No Gamester&mdash;That
he is sober, modest, and virtuous; and
has Qualities that Mothers would be fond of in
a Husband for their Daughters; and for which, perhaps,
their Daughters would be the happier, could
they judge as well for themselves as Experience may
teach them to judge for their future Daughters.
In other Places he is represented as charitable, considerate
to Inferiors, so obliging and respectful to his
Mother-in-law, that she leaves him at her Death, in
Acknowledgment of it, all that was in her Power:
And Miss <i>Howe</i> owns he never disobliged her by
Word or Look. What then is the Objection to
Mr. <i>Hickman</i>? Why truly, he has not <i>Lovelace's</i> fine
Person!&mdash;<i>Lovelace's</i> fine Address!&mdash;<i>Lovelace's</i> impetuous
Spirit; and yet he has shewn even <i>Lovelace</i>,
that he wants not Courage. He is plain in his
Dress!&mdash;His Gait shews him not to be so debonnaire
in dancing a Minuit as <i>Lovelace</i>.&mdash;But, indeed,
I am afraid whoever prefers a <i>Lovelace</i> to a <i>Hickman</i>,
will wish all her life-time she could have sooner
found out, that tho' <i>Lovelace</i> was the best Partner
at a Ball; yet, when a Companion for Life was to
be chose, that Mr. <i>Hickman's</i> Goodness of Heart
rendered him in all respects more essential to Happiness;
much more eligible than all the gay, fluttering,
and parading Spirit of a <i>Lovelace</i> could possibly
have done. And your Favourite <i>Clarissa</i>, Miss <i>Gibson</i>,
says in a Letter to Miss <i>Howe</i>; 'Will you never,
my Dear, give the Weight which you, and
all our Sex ought to give to the Qualities of So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>briety
and Regularity of Life and Manners in that
Sex?&mdash;Must bold Creatures and forward Spirits
for ever, and by the wisest and best of us, as well
as by the indiscretest, be the most kindly used?&mdash;be
best thought of'?</p>

<p>Again, in her posthumous Letter&mdash;'Your Choice
is fallen upon a sincere, an honest, a virtuous, and
what is more than all, a <i>pious Man</i>.&mdash;A Man who
altho' he admires your Person, is still more in love
with the Graces of your Mind; and as those Graces
are improvable with every added Year of Life,
which will impair the transitory ones of Person,
what a firm Basis has Mr. <i>Hickman</i> chosen to
build his Love upon.'</p>

<p>The same Man cannot be every thing: A <i>Hickman</i>
in Heart, to a <i>Lovelace</i> in Vivacity and Address,
perhaps, is almost impossible to be met with; Time,
Opportunities, and Inclinations are wanting.</p>

<p>Nay, Madam, says Miss <i>Gibson</i>, I do not dispute
Mr. <i>Hickman's</i> being preferable for a Husband to
Mr. <i>Lovelace</i>; the Heart is certainly the first thing
to be considered in a Man to whose Government a
Woman resigns herself; but I should not chuse either
<i>Lovelace</i> or <i>Hickman</i>. I must confess I should
desire Humour and Spirit in a Man. A married
Life, tho' it cannot be said to be miserable with an
honest Husband; yet it must be very dull, when a
Man has not the Power of diversifying his Ideas
enough to display trifling Incidents in various Lights;
and 'tis impossible where this is wanting, but that a
Man and his Wife must often depend on other Company
to keep them from sinking into Insipidity.
And for my part, I cannot paint to myself any
thing more disagreeable, than to sit with a Husband
and wish some-body would come in and relieve us
from one another's Dulness. Trifles, Madam, become
strong Entertainments to sprightly Minds!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah! Miss <i>Gibson</i>, replied the Lady, in every Word
you speak, you prove how necessary the Author's
Moral is to be strongly inculcated; when even <i>your</i>
serious and thoughtful Turn of Mind will not suffer
you to see through the Glare of what you call Humour
and Spirit with that Clearness which would
enable you to distinguish how very seldom that
Humour and Spirit is bestowed on a Wife. Mr.
<i>Hickman's</i> whole Mind being at Home, would enliven
him into a chearful Companion with his Wife;
whilst a <i>Lovelace's</i> Mind, engaged on foreign Objects,
would often make him fall into Peevishness
and Ill-humour, instead of this so much dreaded
<i>Insipidity</i>.</p>

<p>Indeed, Madam, said Miss <i>Gibson</i>, I don't plead
for Mr. <i>Lovelace</i>; for I detest him of all the Men I
ever read of.</p>

<p>That is true, replied the Lady; but that is because
you have <i>read</i> of him, and know the Villanies he
was capable of. But yet, I think, you have plainly
proved, if a <i>Lovelace</i> and a <i>Hickman</i> contended for
your Favour, which would have the best Chance of
succeeding.</p>

<p>Miss <i>Gibson</i> blushed, and was silent; when a
sprightly Girl, of about Sixteen, said, She loved
Mr. <i>Hickman</i> very much; he was a good, and a
gentle-hearted Man&mdash;But indeed she should not like
him for her Husband.</p>

<p>The Gentlemen, during this Debate, had all sat
silent; but they often smiled to see how few Advocates
Mr. <i>Hickman</i> was likely to have amongst the
Ladies.</p>

<p>At last <i>Bellario</i> said, If I had not thought so before,
I should now be convinced by this Conversation,
how judicious the Author of <i>Clarissa</i> was in
setting forth so very strongly as he does, the Necessity
of Sobriety and Goodness in a Husband, in or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>der
to render a married State happy. For you have
shown clearly, Ladies, how difficult it is for a Man
to be esteemed by you who has those Qualities, since
I can see no one Objection to Mr. <i>Hickman</i>, but that
he has not that Gaiety of Disposition which from a
vast Flow of animal Spirits, without Restraint or
Curb from either Principles of Religion or Good-nature,
shines forth in <i>Lovelace's</i> wild Fancies. And
this Man you find such a Reluctance to speak well
of; tho' a reforming <i>Belford</i> esteems; Colonel
<i>Morden</i> highly values him; and says, he is respected
by all the World!&mdash;And a <i>Clarissa</i> for ever <a name="acknowleges" id="acknowleges"></a>acknowledges
his Merit.&mdash;And, in one of the last Actions
of her Life, praises him as he deserves to be praised.
And earnestly recommends it to her best and dear
Friend, to give both her Hand and Heart to so
worthy a Man. The steady Principles of Mr. <i>Hickman</i>
was a firm Basis to depend on, for Protection
and good Usage.</p>

<p>Miss <i>Gibson</i> was so much pleased with seeing <i>Bellario</i>
enter so heartily into the Design of the Author of
<i>Clarissa</i>, that she dropp'd the Argument, (tho' she
did not seem quite convinc'd that Mr. <i>Hickman</i> could
be an agreeable Husband) and with some Earnestness
desired <i>Bellario</i> to tell her, whether he was not
now convinced that <i>Clarissa</i> was capable of the
strongest Affection, could she but have found the
least Foundation to have built that Affection on:
Yes, replied <i>Bellario</i>, I am convinced of it, and am
surprised that I did not before see how much <i>Lovelace's</i>
base unmanly Behaviour justifies her in this
Point; he himself, indeed, in the Letter he writes
<i>Belford</i> after he left <i>England</i>, lays the whole Scene
before us; to his own Condemnation, and <i>Clarissa's</i>
eternal Honour: He owns her meek and gentle
Spirit; confesses he repeatedly, from the first, poured
cold Water on her rising Flame, by meanly and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>gratefully
turning upon her the Injunctions which
Virgin Delicacy, and filial Duty induced her to lay
him under before he got her into his Power; he
quotes her own Words: <i>That she could not be guilty
of Affectation or Tyranny to the Man she intended to
marry</i>; that from the Time he had got her from
her Father's House, <i>he had a plain Path before him;</i>
that <i>he had held her Soul in suspense an Hundred times;</i>
that <i>she would have had no Reserves, had he not given
her Cause of Doubt</i>; that she owned to <i>Belford</i>, that
<i>once she could have loved him; and could she have made
him Good would have made him Happy</i>.</p>

<p>To this Letter, continued <i>Bellario</i>, and numerous
other Places in the Book, would I refer all those, if
any such there are, who yet doubt her being capable
of Love. Surely we may fairly conclude with
<i>Lovelace</i>, that well might she, who had been used to
be courted and admired by every desiring Eye, and
worshipped by every respectful Heart&mdash;Well might
such a Woman be allowed to draw back, when she
found herself kept in suspence, as to the great Question
of all, by a designing and intriguing Spirit, pretending
Awe and Distance, as Reasons for reining
in a Fervour, which, if real, cannot be reined in.</p>

<p><i>Clarissa</i> seems indeed, as Colonel <i>Morden</i> says, (added
the now-admiring <i>Bellario</i>) to have been, as
much as Mortal could be, LOVE ITSELF.</p>

<p>Miss <i>Gibson</i> was highly delighted with what <i>Bellario</i>
said, and added to it, That she thought <i>Clarissa's</i>
frankness of Heart was very apparent, from the manner
in which she had treated those Gentlemen her Heart
had obliged her to refuse, and from the generous
Advice she in so many Places gives Miss <i>Howe</i>, in
relation to her Treatment of Mr. <i>Hickman</i>: And pray,
Sir, continued Miss <i>Gibson</i>, pardon my asking you
one Question more, namely; whether you are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
now satisfied with the Conduct of the Author in the
Management of his whole Story?</p>

<p><i>Bellario</i> answered, That he was not only satisfied
with it, but highly applauded all the material Parts
of it; that the various distressful Situations in which
you had placed your Heroine, were noble beyond
Expression; that these three last Volumes contained
many Scenes, each singly arising to as high a Tragedy
as can possibly be wrote; that the Tears you
had drawn from his Eyes were such Tears as flow'd
from a Heart at once filled with Admiration and
Compassion, and labouring under Sensations too
strong for any Utterance in Words; and that for the
Sake of <i>Clarissa</i>, he would never form any Judgment
of a Work again till the whole was lain before
him. This was noble! this was candid! this was like
<i>Bellario</i>! and Miss <i>Gibson</i> could not forbear saying,
that she rejoyced in the Tears <i>he</i> had shed for <i>Clarissa</i>.
And, Sir, (continued she) 'I am convinced,
that those whose Eyes melt not at Scenes of well-wrought
Distress, cannot properly be said to laugh,
from a liberal and chearful Spirit, at the true Scenes
of comic Humour.'</p>

<p>'The Beginning of this Season I went with a
Lady, whose Acquaintance I accidentally fell into,
to <i>Drury-Lane</i> Play-house, where Mr. <i>Garrick</i>
performed the Part of King <i>Lear</i>. I should have
thought (tho' altered and defaced as it is by Mr.
<i>Tate</i>) that even Butchers must have wept; but to
my great Astonishment, my Companion sat unmoved:
Silent indeed she was, only now and then
said, <i>she did not love Tragedy</i>; that, for her part,
<i>she had rather laugh than cry</i>, and liked a Comedy
best. I had a Curiosity to see in what manner
comic Scenes would affect her; and therefore
proposed going to <i>Covent-Garden</i> Play-house the
next Night, when Mr. <i>Quin</i> was to play the Part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of Sir <i>John Falstaff</i>, in <i>Harry</i> the Fourth. Accordingly
we went. The Lady did, indeed, now and
then catch the Laugh of those around her, enough
to move about her Features a little; but upon the
whole, was pretty near as unmov'd as she had been
the Night before; and at last she confessed, that
the Humours of Sir <i>John Falstaff</i> was not the Sort
of Comedy that pleased her Fancy; but that the
merry Dialogues between <i>Tom</i> and <i>Phillis</i> in the
<i>Conscious Lovers</i>, and the comical Humours of <i>Ben</i>
and Miss <i>Prue</i> in <i>Love for Love</i>, were more suited to
her Taste. I was not much surprised, because I before
suspected, that whoever could sit the Play of King
<i>Lear</i> without weeping, would see Sir <i>John Falstaff</i>
without laughing.'</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Dellincourt</i> now raised a new Objection to
<i>Clarissa</i>, in that she talked so much of Religion,
which he call'd Canting. Nay, Sir, said <i>Bellario</i>,
'I cannot see how she can be said to cant; for her
religious Reflections are neither nonsensical or affected,
but such as naturally arise from a pious
Mind in her several Situations; and if you are a
Christian, Sir, I am sure you cannot, on Consideration,
dislike that Part of her Character.' Mr. <i>Dellincourt</i>
said, 'Yes, he was a Christian, and he did
not dislike some of her Reflections, at least when
she was near Death; but he thought she talked
too much of Religion at the Beginning; for it
was unnatural for a young Beauty to have such
grave Thoughts.' <i>Bellario</i> smiled and said,</p>

<p>'You put me in mind, Sir, of Dame <i>Quickly</i>,
who when Sir <i>John Falstaff</i>, in his Illness, calls
upon God, told him, to comfort him, she hoped
there was no Occasion yet to think of any such
Matters; supposing, that to think of God, except
he was quite dying, was very unnecessary. And,
indeed, I have often known a professed Christian
excuse introducing a Word of Religion into Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>pany,
as if it would be indecent to mention any
such matters; but as to <i>Clarissa</i>, I think the Principles
she had imbibed from her Infancy from the
good and pious Mrs. <i>Norton</i>, and which were afterwards
strengthned by her Conversation with
Doctor <i>Lewin</i>, renders it very natural for her to
be early and steadily religious.' Mr. <i>Dellincourt</i>
made no Answer, but dropped his Objection; and
Mr. <i>Barker</i> said, 'that he thought there was one great
Fault in the Conduct of your Story; and that was,
the Indelicacy of making <i>Clarissa</i> seek <i>Lovelace</i>
after the Outrage; for that he was strongly of
Opinion, that she had better have escaped from
Mrs. <i>Sinclair's</i> and have avoided the Sight of
<i>Lovelace</i>.' 'Indeed, Sir, said Miss <i>Gibson</i>, I believe
she would have been very thankful for your Advice,
if you could at the same time have found
out any Expedient to have put it in Execution;
but if you will please to recollect, you may remember
the Difficulty she had to escape once before,
even when she was not suspected; and <i>Lovelace</i>
now could have no manner of doubt, but that she
would fly that House, if not prevented, as soon as
her Strength would permit her to leave her Bed.</p>

<p>As to the Indelicacy of <i>Clarissa's</i> seeking <i>Lovelace</i>,
said <i>Bellario</i>, 'I confess I do not see it; however, I
will leave that matter to be decided by the Ladies',
who all agreed, that they thought it no Breach of
the strictest Modesty to declare it was their Opinion,
that the whole Scene, as it now stands, is what it <i>should
be</i>, and would have admited of no Alteration, but
for the worse; that the picturesque Manner in which
a young Woman, without Fear or Confusion, beholds
the Man who dared imagine his Guilt could
baffle all her Resolutions, and sink her Soul to Cowardice,
most beautifully displays the Power of conscious
Innocence; and, on the other hand, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
confused Mind, the flattering Speech, unavoidable
even by a <i>Lovelace</i> when his guilty Soul was awed
by the Presence of an Object injured beyond the
Power of Reparation, displays the Deformity of
Wickedness in all its Force. In short, this Scene
was allowed to be Virtue's Triumph, and <i>Clarissa's</i>
Conduct to be a direct Opposition to that of all those
whining Women, who blubber out an humble Petition
to be joined for Life to the Men who have betrayed
them.</p>

<p>Had not <i>Clarissa</i> seen <i>Lovelace</i>, said Miss <i>Gibson</i>,
her Triumph could never have been so compleat;
and as I think the Impossibility of her Escape at that
time, from Mrs. <i>Sinclair's</i>, is very apparent, had
she not sought him, the true Lovers of <i>Clarissa</i> must
have mourned the Loss of seeing her Behaviour in
such an uncommon Situation.</p>

<p><i>Bellario</i> gave these Sentiments a Sanction by his
Approbation, and the rest of the Company either
concurr'd with his Opinion, or at least did not contradict
him; and the next Day Miss <i>Gibson</i> received
the following Letter from <i>Bellario</i>.</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="bump"><span class="gesperrt" style="margin-right: -.4em;"><i>MADAM</i></span>,</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">Y</span><span class="upper">ou</span> seem'd so pleased last Night with my Conversion,
if I may be allowed the Expression,
to your Favourite <i>Clarissa</i>, that I could not seek
any Repose till I had thrown together my Thoughts
on that Head, in order to address them to you; nor
am I ashamed to confess, that the Author's Design
is more noble, and his Execution of it much happier,
than I even suspected till I had seen the whole.</p>

<p>In a Series of familiar Letters to relate a compleat
Story, where there is such a Variety of Characters,
every one conducing to the forming the necessary
Incidents to the Completion of that Story, is a Method
so intirely new, so much an Original manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of Writing, that the Author seems to have a Right
to make his own Laws; the painting Nature is indeed
his Aim, but the Vehicle by which he conveys
his lively Portraits to the Mind is so much his own
Invention, that he may guide and direct it according
to his own Will and Pleasure. <i>Aristotle</i> drew his
Rules of Epic Poetry from <i>Homer</i>, and not <i>Homer</i>
from <i>Aristotle</i>; tho' had they been Cotemporaries,
perhaps that had been a Point much disputed.</p>

<p>As to the Length of the Story, I fancy that Complaint
arises from the great Earnestness the Characters
inspire the Reader with to know the Event; and
on a second Reading may vanish. <i>Clarissa</i> is not
intended as a Dramatic, but as a real Picture of human
Life, where Story can move but slowly, where
the Characters must open by degrees, and the Reader's
own Judgment form them from different Parts, as
they display themselves according to the Incidents
that arise. As for Example; the Behaviour of
<i>Lovelace</i> to his Rosebud must strike every one, at
first View, with Admiration and Esteem for him;
but when his Character comes to blaze in its full
Light, it is very apparent that his Pride preserved
his Rosebud, as well as it destroyed <i>Clarissa</i>; like
<i>Milton's Satan</i>, he could for a Time cloath himself
like an Angel of Light, even to the Deception of
<i>Uriel</i>.</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
<i>For neither Man, nor Angel can discern<br />
Hypocrisie; the only Evil that walks<br />
Invisible, except to God alone,<br />
By his permissive Will, through Heaven and Earth:<br />
And oft, though Wisdom wake, Suspicion sleeps<br />
At Wisdom's Gate, and to Simplicity<br />
Resigns her Charge; while Goodness thinks no ill<br />
Where no Ill seems; which now, for once, beguiled</i><br />
Uriel, <i>though Regent of the Sun, and held<br />
The sharpest-sighted Spirit of all in Heaven.</i><br />
</div></div>

<p>Proud Spirits, such as <i>Satan's</i> and <i>Lovelace's</i>, require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Objects of their Envy, as Food for their Malice,
to compleat their Triumph and applaud their
own Wickedness. From this Incident of the Rosebud,
and the subsequent Behaviour of <i>Lovelace</i>,
arises a Moral which can never be too often inculcated;
namely, that Pride has the Art of putting on the Mask
of Virtue in so many Forms, that we must judge
of a Man upon the whole, and not from any one
single Action.</p>

<p>A celebrated <i>French</i> Critick says, that</p>

<p>'An indifferent Wit may form a vast Design in
his Imagination; but it must be an <span class="smcap">Extraordinary
Genius</span> that can work his Design, and fashion
it according to Justness and Proportion: For
'tis necessary that the same Spirit <i>reign throughout</i>;
that all contribute to the same <i>End</i>; and that all
the <i>Parts</i> bear a secret <i>Relation</i> to each other; all
depend on this Relation and Alliance.'</p>

<p>Let the nicest Critick examine the Story of <i>Clarissa</i>,
and see if in any Point it fails of coming
up exactly to the before-mentioned Rule. The Author
had all Nature before him, and he has beautifully
made use of every Labyrinth, in the several
Minds of his Characters, to lead him to his purposed
End.</p>

<p>The Obstinacy of old <i>Harlowe</i>, who never gave
up a Point, unaccustomed to Contradiction, and
mad with the Thoughts of his own Authority; the
Pride of the two old Batchelors, who had lived
single, in order to aggrandize their Family; the overbearing
impetuous <i>James Harlowe's</i> Envy, arising
from Ambition; the two-fold Envy of <i>Arabella
Harlowe</i>, springing from Rivalship in general Admiration,
as well as in particular liking; the former
more rough, the latter more sly, tho' full as keen
in her Reproaches; the constant Submission of Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<i>Harlowe</i>, and the mad Vanity of <i>Lovelace</i>, all conspire
to the grand End of distressing and destroying
the poor <i>Clarissa</i>; whose Misfortune it was to
be placed amongst a Set of Wretches, who were
every one following the Bent of their own peculiar
Madness, without any Consideration for the innocent
Victim who was to fall a Sacrifice to their ungovernable
Passions. And here I must observe, how
artfully the Author has conducted the opening of his
different Characters, as they became more interested
in his Story. The Correspondence between Miss
<i>Howe</i> and <i>Clarissa</i>, with some characteristical Letters
of each of the <i>Harlowes</i>, as these were then
his principal Actors, chiefly compose the two first
Volumes.</p>

<p>In the third, fourth and fifth Volumes, <i>Lovelace</i>
comes prancing before the Reader's Eye; gives an
unrestrained Loose to his uncurbed Imagination,
and ripens into full-blown Baseness that Blackness
of Mind, which had hitherto only shot forth in
Buds but barely visible. The strong and lively Pen of
<i>Lovelace</i> was most proper to relate the most active
Scenes. But when his mischievous Heart and plotting
Head had left him no farther use for his wild
Fancies, than to rave and curse his own Folly, <i>Belford</i>
takes up the Pen, and carries on the Story; and
in the sixth and seventh Volumes, Colonel <i>Morden</i> (who
has hitherto made but a small Appearance) is brought
upon the Stage, and his Character, as he is to be the
Instrument of the Death of <i>Lovelace</i>, is as strongly
painted, and as necessary to the Completion of the
Story, as are any of the others. It is astonishing
to me how much the different Stile of each Writer
is in every Particular preserved; indeed so characteristically
preserved, that when I read <i>Clarissa's</i> Letters,
where every Line speaks the considerate and
the pious Mind, I could almost think the Author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
had studied nothing but her Character. When
Miss <i>Howe's</i> lively Vein and flowing Wit entertains
me, She appears to have been the principal Person
in his Thoughts. When Mrs. <i>Harlowe</i> writes, her
broken half-utter'd Sentences are so many Pictures
of the broken timorous Spirit of Meekness tyrannised
over, that dictates to her Pen. When Mr.
<i>Harlowe</i> condescends to sign his much valued Name,
the dictatorial Spirit of an indulged tyrannic Disposition
indites every arbitrary Command. When
<i>John Harlowe</i> writes, the Desire of proving himself
of Consequence from his Fortune, and being
infected with the Idea of his Niece's Disobedience,
(a Word which continually resounded through his
Family) plainly appear to be the only two Causes
that make him insist on her Compliance. In <i>Anthony
Harlowe's</i> Roughness and Reproaches, 'The
Sea prosper'd Gentleman, (as <i>Clarissa</i> says) not used
to any but elemental Controul, and even ready to
buffet that, blusters as violently as the Winds he
was accustomed to be angry at.' In <i>James Harlowe's</i>
Letters, we see how the Mind infected with the
complicated Distemper of Envy, Insolence and
Malice, can blot the fair Paper, and poison it with
its Venom. In <i>Arabella Harlowe</i>, the sly Insinuations
of feminine Envy break forth in every taunting
Word, and she could "speak Daggers, tho' she dared
not use them." But, to imitate our Author, in turning
suddenly from this detestable Picture, how does
every Line of the good Mrs. <i>Norton</i> shew us a Mind
inured to, and patiently submitting to Adversity,
looking on Contempt as the unavoidable Consequence
of Poverty, and fixed in a firm and pious
Resolution of going through all the Vicissitudes of
this transitory Life without repining.</p>

<p>Nor does the Author fail more in the preserving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the characteristical Difference of Stile in the Writings
of <i>Mowbray</i>, <i>Belford</i> and <i>Lovelace</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mowbray</i>, tho' he writes but two Letters in the
whole, yet do those two so strongly fix his Character,
that every Reader may see of what Consequence
he made himself to Society; namely, to act the
blustring Part in a Club of Rakes, to fill a Seat at the
Table, and assist in keeping up the Roar and Noise
necessary to make the Life of such Assemblies.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Belford's</i> Letters prove, that he acts the
second Part under Mr. <i>Lovelace</i>; he follows the Paths
the other beats through the thorny Labyrinths of wild
Libertinism; he has not the lively Humour of <i>Lovelace</i>,
altho' in Understanding I think he has rather
the Advantage; and his not being quite so lively,
is owing to his not giving such a loose to every unbridled
Fancy; but he has less Pride, and consequently
more Humanity: this appears in the many
Arguments he makes use of to his Friend in favour
of <i>Clarissa</i>; but these Arguments, as they are only
the Produce of sudden Starts of Compassion, and have
no fixed Principle for their Basis, could have no Weight
with <i>Lovelace</i>; and the fluctuating of a Mind sometimes
intruded upon by the Force of Good-nature,
and then again actuated by the Principles of Libertinism,
is finely set before us by <i>Belford's</i> Writings.
And as there is a great Beauty throughout the whole
of <i>Clarissa</i>, in the specific Difference of Stile preserved
by every Writer, so is there an inimitable
Beauty in <i>Belford</i> differing from himself, when he
changes the State of his Mind; his Stile accompanies
that Change, and he appears another Man.
He was always more of the true Gentleman in his Stile
than <i>Lovelace</i>, because his Will was not enough overbearing
to break through all Bounds; but when his
Mind is softned by the many different Deaths he is
witness of, and he becomes animated by <i>Clarissa's</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Example to think in earned of reforming his Life,
the Gentleman and the Christian increase together,
till he becomes at once the Executor of <i>Clarissa's</i>
Will, and, if I may be allowed the Expression, the
Heir to her Principles.</p>

<p>In <i>Lovelace's</i> Stile, his Humour, his Parts, his
Pride, his wild Desire of throwing Difficulties in his
own way, in order to conquer them, and exercise his
own intriguing Spirit, break forth in every Line.
His impetuous Will, unrestrained from his Infancy,
as he himself complains, by his Mother, and long
accustomed to bear down all before it, destroys
the Gentleman, and equally every other amiable
Qualification: For tho' a Knowledge of the
Customs of the World may make a Man in Company,
where he stays but a little while, appear
polite; yet when that Man indulges himself in
gratifying continually his own wild Humour, those
who are intimate with him, must often have Cause
to complain of his Unpoliteness; as <i>Clarissa</i> does of
<i>Lovelace</i>. And by such Complaints of <i>Clarissa</i>, I
think it is very apparent, that the Author designed
<i>Lovelace</i> should be unpolite, notwithstanding his
Station, in order to prove that indulged overbearing
Passions will trample under Foot every
Bar that would stop them in their raging Course.
But now I am upon the Subject of the different
Stiles in <i>Clarissa</i>, I must observe how strictly
the Author has kept up in all the Writings of his
Rakes to what he says of <i>Lovelace</i> in his Preface.</p>

<div class="blockquote">'That they preserve a Decency, as well in
their Images, as in their Language, which is not
always to be found in the Works of some of the
most celebrated modern Writers, whose Subjects
and Characters have less warranted the Liberties
they have taken.'</div>

<p>The various Stiles adapted to the many different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Characters in <i>Clarissa</i> make so great a Variety, as
would, it attended to, in a great Measure, answer
any Objection that might otherwise fairly be raised
to the Length of the Story.</p>

<p>There is one Thing has almost astonished me
in the Criticisms I have heard on <i>Clarissa's</i> Character;
namely, that they are in a Manner a Counterpart
to the Reproaches cast on her in her Lifetime.</p>

<p>She has been called perverse and obstinate by
many of her Readers; <i>James Harlowe</i> called her so
before them. Some say she was romantic; so said
<i>Bella</i>; disobedient; all the <i>Harlowes</i> agree in that;
a Prude; so said <i>Salley Martin</i>; had a Mind incapable
of Love; Mr. <i>Lovelace's</i> Accusation; for he
must found his Brutality on some Shadow of a
Pretence, tho' he confesses at last it was but a Shadow,
for that he knew the contrary the whole Time.
Others say, she was artful and cunning, had the
Talent only to move the Passions; the haughty
Brother and spiteful Sister's Plea to banish her from
her Parents Presence. I verily think I have not heard
<i>Clarissa</i> condemned for any one Fault, but the Author
has made some of the <i>Harlowes</i>, or some of
Mrs. <i>Sinclair's</i> Family accuse her of it before.</p>

<p>As I have, as concisely as I could, pointed out the
Difference in the chief Characters of <i>Clarissa</i>, all
necessary to the same End; in the same Manner
could I go through the Scenes all as essentially different,
and rising in due Proportion one after another,
till all the vast Building centers in the pointed
View of the Author's grand Design. Of all the
lively well-painted Scenes in the four first Volumes,
and all those in the fifth previous to the Night before
the Outrage, mention but any of the most
trifling Circumstances, such as <i>Clarissa's</i> torn Rufles,
and Remembrance places her before us in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Agonies of the strongest Distress; insulted over by
the vilest of Women, and prostrate on her Knees imploring
Mercy at the Feet of her Destroyer. Her
Madness equals, (I had almost said exceeds) any
Thing of the Kind that ever was written: That
hitherto so peculiar Beauty in King <i>Lear</i>, of preserving
the Character even in Madness, appears
strongly in <i>Clarissa</i>: the same self-accusing Spirit,
the same humble Heart, the same pious Mind
breathes in her scattered Scrapes of Paper in the
midst of her Frenzy; and the Irregularity and sudden
broken Starts of her Expressions alone can
prove that her Senses are disordered. Her Letter to
<i>Lovelace</i>, where, even in Madness, <i>galling</i> Reproach
drops not from her Pen, and which contains only
Supplications that she may not be farther persecuted,
speaks the very Soul of <i>Clarissa</i>, and by the Author
of her Story could have been wrote for no one but
herself. Whoever can read her earnest Request to
<i>Lovelace</i>, that she may not be exposed in a public
Mad-house, on the Consideration that it might injure
<i>him</i>, without being overwhelmed in Tears, I
am certain has not in himself the Concord of sweet
Sounds, and, must, as <i>Shakespear</i> says, be fit for
Treasons, Stratagems and Spoils. And to close at
once, all I will say of the Author's Conduct in regard
to the managing (what seems most unmanageable)
the Mind even when overcome by Madness,
he has no where made a stronger Contrast between
<i>Clarissa</i> and <i>Lovelace</i>, or kept the Characters more
distinct than in their Madness. I have already mentioned
how much <i>Clarissa's</i> Thoughts in her Frenzy
apparently flow from the same Channel, tho' more
disturbed and less clear than when her uninterrupted
Reason kept on its steady Course. <i>Lovelace's</i> Character
is not less preserved: his Pen or Tongue
indeed seldom uttered the Words of Reason,
but the same overbearing Passions, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Pride of Heart that had accustomed him to strut in
his fancy'd Superiority, makes him condemn all the
World but himself; and rave that <i>Bedlam</i> might be
enlarged, imagining, that a general Madness had
seized Mankind, and he alone was exempt from the
dreadful Catastrophy.</p>

<p>In the Penknife Scene <i>Clarissa</i> is firmly brave; her
Soul abhorred Self-murder, nor would she, as she told
Miss <i>Howe</i>, willingly like a Coward quit her Post; but
in this Case, could she not have awed <i>Lovelace</i> into Distance,
tho' <i>her</i> Hand had pointed the Knife, yet might
<i>he</i> properly have been said to have struck the Blow.
The picturesque Attitude of all present, when <i>Clarissa</i>
suddenly cries out, 'God's Eye is upon us'
has an Effect upon the Mind that can only be felt;
and that it would be a weak and vain Effort for
Language to attempt to utter.</p>

<p>In the Prison Scene <i>Clarissa</i> exerts a different kind
of Bravery. Insult and Distress, Cold and Hardships,
to what she was accustomed to, she bears almost
in silence; and by her Suffering without repining,
without Fear of any thing but <i>Lovelace</i>, she
is the strongest Proof of what <i>Shakespear</i> says, that</p>

<div class="block">
<div class="poem">
<i>&mdash;&mdash;where the greater Malady is <a name="fxt" id="fxt"></a>fixt<br />
The Lesser is scarce felt&mdash;&mdash;</i><br />
</div></div>

<p>And let those who have accused <i>Clarissa</i> of having
a suspicious Temper, from her being apt to suspect
<i>Lovelace</i>, here confess, that it must be the Person's
Fault at whom her Suspicion is level'd, when she
wants that Companion of a great Mind, a generous
Confidence; for how soon does <i>Belford's</i> honest
Intentions breaking forth in the Manner in which he
addresses her, make her rely on the known Friend
of her Destroyer, and the publick Companion of all
his Rakeries. Nor can I here pass by in perfect Si<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>lence,
the noble Simplicity with which <i>Clarissa</i> sums
up her Story to Mrs. <i>Smith</i> and Mrs. <i>Lovick</i>; for I
think 'tis the strongest Pattern that can be imagined
of that Simplicity which strikes to the Heart, and melts
the Soul with all the softer Passions.</p>

<p>In Colonel <i>Morden's</i> Account of the conveying
the lifeless Remains of the Divine <i>Clarissa</i> to be interred
in the Vault of her Ancestors, his very Words
keep solemn Pace with the Herse which incloses her
once animated, now lifeless, Form. Step by Step
we still attend her; turn with the Horses as they
take the Bye-road to <i>Harlow-place</i>; start with the
wretched, guilty Family, at the first Stroke of the
mournful tolling Bell; are fixed in Amazement with
the lumbering heavy Noise of the Herse up the paved
inner Court-yard: But when the Servant comes in
to acquaint the Family with its Arrival, and we read
this Line, <i>He spoke not, he could not speak; he looked,
he bowed, and withdrew</i>, we catch the Servant's silent
Grief; our Words are choaked, and our Sensations
grow too strong for Utterance. The awful Respect
paid to <i>Clarissa's</i> Memory by those Persons, who
generally both rejoice and mourn in Noise and Clamour,
is inimitably beautiful. But even in this
solemn Scene the Author has not forgot the Characters
of the principal Actors in it: For the barbarous
Wretches who could drive <i>Clarissa</i> from her native
Home, and by their Cruelty hurl her to Destruction,
could not shed Tears for her Loss, without
mingled Bitterness, and sharp-cutting Recriminations
on each other; every one striving to rid themselves
of the painful Load, and to throw it doubly
on their former Companions in Guilt. The Mother
only, as she was the least guilty, deplores the heavy
Loss with soft melting Tears, and lets Self-accusations
flow from her trembling Lips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>On the Arrival of Miss <i>Howe</i>, we turn from the
slow moving Herse, to the rapid Chariot-wheels that
fly to bring the warm Friend, all glowing with the
most poignant lively Grief, to mourn her lost <i>Clarissa</i>.
Here again the Description equals the noble
Subject. Miss <i>Howe</i>, at the first striking Sight of
<i>Clarissa</i> in her Coffin, could only by frantic Actions
express the labouring Anguish that perturbed her
Breast. And we accompany her in Horror, when
she first impatiently pushes aside the Coffin Lid.
In short, we sigh, we rave, and we weep with her.</p>

<p>What I felt at Colonel <i>Morden's</i> Description at
the Funeral, is exactly painted in the Letter wrote
by Mr. <i>Belford</i> in Answer to that Description, where
he says,</p>

<div class="blockquote">'You croud me Sir, methinks, into the silent,
slow Procession&mdash;Now with the sacred Bier do I
enter the Porch&mdash;'<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></div>

<p>But it would be endless to mention all the moving
tragic Scenes, that are now crouding into my Mind,
in <i>Clarissa</i>; all judiciously interspersed with Scenes
of comic Humour; such as the Behaviour of <i>Lovelace</i>
at the Ball; the Meeting between him and Mr.
<i>Hickman</i>; <i>Lovelace's</i> Description of what he calls
his Tryal before Lord M&mdash;and the Ladies; with
some others equally calculated to relieve the Mind
from fixing too long on mournful melancholy Ideas.</p>

<p>Finely has the Author of <i>Clarissa</i> set forth what is
true, and what is false Honour. When <i>Lovelace</i>
upbraids <i>Belford</i> for not preserving <i>Clarissa</i>, by betraying
his own villainous Plots and Machinations
to destroy her; and says, 'I am sure now, that I
would have thanked thee for it with all my Heart,
and thought thee more a Father and a Friend,
than my real Father and my best Friend.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p><p>All false Shame has he exposed, by shewing the
Beauties of an open and frank Heart in <i>Clarissa's</i>
charming Simplicity, when she tells Mrs. <i>Smith</i>, in
a publick Shop, that she had been in Prison; and
when in a Letter to Lady <i>Betty Laurance</i> she declares,
that <i>the Disgrace she cannot hide from herself,
she is not sollicitous to conceal from the World</i>.</p>

<p>True and false Friendship was never more beautifully
displayed than in this Work; the firm, the
steady Flame that burns in the fixed Affection between
<i>Clarissa</i> and Miss <i>Howe</i>, which, in <i>Clarissa's</i>
Words, <i>has Virtue for its Base</i>, is both well described
and accounted for by Colonel <i>Morden</i>; and that
Chaff and Stubble, as she well calls it, that <i>has not
Virtue for its Base</i>, is inimitably painted by <i>Belford</i>,
in his Account of <i>Mowbray's</i> Behaviour to the dying
<i>Belton</i>. 'It is such a horrid thing (says he) to think
of, that a Man who had lived in such strict Terms
of Amity with another (the Proof does not come
out so as to say Friendship) who had pretended so
much Love for him, could not bear to be out of
his Company, would ride an hundred Miles an End
to enjoy it, and would fight for him, be the Cause
right or wrong; yet now could be so little moved
to see him in such Misery of Body and Mind as
to be able to rebuke him, and rather ridicule than
pity him; because he was more affected by what
he felt, than he had seen a Malefactor (hardened
perhaps by Liquor, and not softened by previous
Sickness) on his going to Execution.'</p>

<p>What Merit has <i>Clarissa</i> in breaking up and dispersing
this profligate Knot of Friends, that, in
the first Volume, are represented so formidable as to
terrify all the honest People in the Neighbourhood,
who rejoice when they go up to Town again. <i>She</i> was
to revenge on <i>Lovelace</i> his Miss <i>Betterton</i>, his
<i>French</i> Devotee, his <i>French</i> Countess, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Hecatomb which he boasts that he had in different
Climes sacrificed to his <i>Nemesis</i>, and all this by the
natural Effects of his own vile Actions, and her honest
noble Simplicity; whilst she steadily pursues the bright
Path of Innocence, and proposes to herself no other
End, no not even in Thought, but to preserve untainted
her spotless Mind, and diffuse Happiness to
all around her.</p>

<p>I confess I was against the Story's ending unhappily,
till I saw the Conclusion; but I now think
the different Deaths of the many Persons (for in
this Point also the Difference is as essentially preserved,
as in the Characters or Scenes) who fall in
the winding up the Catastrophy in the seventh
Volume, produce as noble a Moral as can be invented
by the Wit of Man.</p>

<p>The broken Spirit, the dejected Heart that pursue
poor <i>Belton</i> through his last Stage of Life (brought
on by a lingering Illness, and ill Usage from an artful
Woman to whom Vice had attached him, and
increased by his Soul's being startled and awaked from
that thoughtless Lethargy in which Vice had so long lulled
him) naturally break forth in those fearful Tremors,
those agonizing pannic Terrors of the Mind, which
follow him to the End, and make a strong and lively
Picture of the Terrors of Death first thought on,
when Life was flying, and could no longer supply
the flowing Blood and vital Heat that animates the
mortal Frame.</p>

<p>Mrs. <i>Sinclair's</i> Death is very different; the Suddenness
of her Departure had not given Time for a
regular Decay of her Strength, and the same animal
Spirits which used to support her in the noisy
Roar of a profligate Life, now like so many Vultures
preyed on her own Bosom, and assisted to express
the dreadful Horrors of an unexpected Death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lovelace</i>, when he comes to die, is full of Rage
and Disappointment; his uncontrouled Spirit, unused
to be baffled, cannot quietly submit to the great
and universal Conqueror Death himself. On his
Death-bed he is a lively Picture of the End of that
worldly Wisdom which is Foolishness with God.
His strong Imagination that assisted him to form and
carry on those <i>cunning</i> Plots which he pursued to his
own Destruction, now assisted his Conscience to torment
his Soul, and set before his Eyes the injured
Innocent who would have contributed to the utmost
of her Power that he might have spent all his Days
in Peace and Joy. In short, he fluttered like a gay
Butterfly in the Sunshine of Prosperity; he wandered
from the Path that leads to Happiness: In the
Bloom of Youth he fell a Sacrifice to his own Folly:
his Life was a Life of Violence, and his Death was
a Death of Rage.</p>

<p>Whilst the gentle <i>Clarissa's</i> Death is the natural
Consequence of her innocent Life; her calm and
prepared Spirit, like a soft smooth Stream, flows
gently on, till it slides from her Misfortunes, and
she leaves the World free from Fear, and animated
only by a lively Hope.</p>

<p>She wished her closing Scene might be happy.
<i>She had her Wish</i>, (says the Author in his Postscript)
<i>it was happy.</i></p>

<p>Nothing ever made so strong a Contrast as the
Deaths of <i>Lovelace</i> and <i>Clarissa</i>. Wild was the
Life of <i>Lovelace</i>, rapid was his Death; gentle was
<i>Clarissa's</i> Life, softly flowed her latest Hours; the
very Word <i>Death</i> seems too harsh to describe her
leaving Life, and her last Breath was like the soft
playing of a western Breeze, all calm! all Peace!
all Quiet!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The true Difference between the Virtuous and the
Vicious lies in the Mind, where the Author of <i>Clarissa</i>
has placed it; <i>Lovelace</i> says well, when he
views the persecuted <i>Clarissa</i> a-sleep.</p>

<div class="blockquote">'See the Difference in our Cases; she the charming
Injured can sweetly sleep, whilst the varlet Injurer
cannot close his Eyes, and has been trying to
no purpose the whole Night to divert his Melancholy,
and to fly from himself.'</div>

<p>Rightly I think in the Author's Postscript is it
observed, that what is called poetical Justice is chimerical,
or rather anti-providential Justice; for God
makes his Sun to shine alike on the Just and the
Unjust. Why then should Man invent a kind of
imaginary Justice, making the common Accidents
of Life turn out favourable to the Virtuous only?
Vain would be the Comforts spoken to the Virtuous
in Affliction, in the sacred Writings, if Affliction
could not be their Lot.</p>

<p>But the Author of <i>Clarissa</i> has in his Postscript
quoted such undoubted Authorities, and given so
many Reasons on the Christian System for his Catastrophy,
that to say more on that Head would be
but repeating his Words. The Variety of Punishments
also of those guilty Persons in this Work
who do not die, and the Rewards of those who are
innocent, I could go through; had not that Postscript,
and the Conclusion supposed to be writ by
Mr. <i>Belford</i>, already done it to my Hands. Only
one thing I must say, that I don't believe the most
revengeful Person upon Earth could wish their worst
Enemy in a more deplorable Situation, than if
<i>Lovelace</i> in his Frenzy, in that charming picturesque
Scene, where he is riding between <i>Uxbridge</i> and
<i>London</i>, when his impatient Spirit is in suspence;
and also when he hears of <i>Clarissa's</i> Death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus have I just hinted at the Heads of the Characters,
the Difference of the chief Scenes, and the
Variety of the several Deaths, all the natural Consequences
of the several Lives, and productive of
the designed noble Moral in <i>Clarissa</i>; and I think
it may be fairly and impartially said, The Web is
wove so strongly, every Part so much depending on
and assisting each other, that to divide any of them,
would be to destroy the whole.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">Y</span><span class="upper">our</span> Good-nature in sending me your
Thoughts on <i>Clarissa</i>, with a Design to give
me Pleasure, I assure you is not thrown away; may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>you have equal Success in every generous Purpose
that fills your Heart, and greater Happiness in this
World, I am sure I cannot wish you.</p>

<p>Most truly, Sir, do you remark, that a Story told
in this Manner can move but slowly, that the Characters
can be seen only by such as attend strictly to
the Whole; yet this Advantage the Author gains
by writing in the present Tense, as he himself calls it,
and in the first Person, that his Strokes penetrate
immediately to the Heart, and we feel all the Distresses
he paints; we not only weep for, but with
<i>Clarissa</i>, and accompany her, step by step, through
all her Distresses.</p>

<p>I see her from the Beginning, in her happy State,
beloved by all around her, studying to deserve that
Love; obedient to her Parents, dependant on their
Will by her own voluntary Act, when her Grandfather
had put it in her Power to be otherwise; respectful
and tender to her Brother and Sister; firm
in her Friendship to Miss <i>Howe</i>; grateful to good
Mrs. <i>Norton</i>, who had carefully watched over her
Infant Years, and delighted to form and instruct her
Mind; kind to her Inferiors; beneficent to all the
Poor, Miserable, and Indigent; and above all, cultivating
and cherishing in her Heart the true Spirit
of Christianity, Meekness, and Resignation; watchful
over her own Conduct, and charitable to the
Failings of others; unwilling to condemn, and rejoicing
in every Opportunity to praise. But as the
Laws of God and Man have placed a Woman totally
in the Power of her Husband, I believe it is
utterly impossible for any young Woman, who has
any Reflection, not to form in her Mind some kind
of Picture of the Sort of Man in whose Power she
would chuse to place herself. That <i>Clarissa</i> did so,
I think, plainly appears, from her steady Resolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to refuse any Man she could not obey with the utmost
Chearfulness; and to whose Will she could
not submit without Reluctance. She would have
had her Husband a Man on whose Principles she
could entirely depend; one in whom she might have
placed such a Confidence, that she might have spoke
her very Thoughts aloud; one from whom she
might have gained Instruction, and from whose Superiority
of Understanding she would have been
pleased to have taken the Rules of her own Actions.
She desired no Reserves, no separate Interest from
her Husband; had no Plots, no Machinations to succeed
in, and therefore wanted not a Man who by artful
Flattery she could have cajoled madly to have worship'd
her; a kind Indulgence, in what was reasonable,
was all her Desire, and that Indulgence to arise from
her own Endeavour to deserve it, and not from any
Blindness cast before her Husband's Eyes by dazzling
Beauty, or cunning Dissimulation; but, from her Infancy,
having the Example daily before her of her Mother's being
tyrannized over, notwithstanding her great
Humility and Meekness, perhaps tyrannized over for
that very Humility and Meekness. She thought a
single Life, in all Probability, would be for her the
happiest; cherishing in her Heart that Characteristic
of a noble Mind, especially in a Woman, of wishing,
as Miss <i>Howe</i> says she did, to pass through Life
unnoted.</p>

<p>In this State of Mind did <i>Lovelace</i> first find <i>Clarissa</i>.
She liked him; his Person and Conversation
were agreeable, but the Libertinism of his Character
terrified her; and her Disapprobation of him restrained
her from throwing the Reins over the Neck
of a Passion she thought might have hurried her into
Ruin. But when by his Artifices, and the Cruelty
of her Friends, she was driven into his Power, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
he not, to use her own Words, treated her with an
Insolence unbecoming a Man, and kept her very
Soul in suspence; fawning at her Feet to marry him,
whilst, in the same Instant, he tried to confuse her
by a Behaviour that put it out of her Power to comply
with him; there was nothing that she would not
have done to oblige him. Then indeed she plainly
saw that her Principles and his Profligacy, her Simplicity
and his Cunning, were not made to be joined;
and when she found such was the Man she liked best,
no Wonder her Desire of a single Life should return.
She saw, indeed, her own Superiority over <i>Lovelace</i>,
but it was his Baseness that made her behold it.
And here I must observe, that in the very same
Breath in which she tells him, <i>Her Soul's above him</i>,
she bids him <i>leave her</i>, that Thought more than
any other makes her resolve, at all Events, to abandon
him. Was this like exulting in her own Understanding,
and proudly (as I have heard it said)
wanting to dictate to the Man she intended for a
Husband? Such a Woman, if I am not greatly mistaken,
would not desire the Man to leave her
because she saw her Soul was above him; but on the
contrary, concealing from him, and disguising her
Thoughts, would have set Art against Art, and been
the more delighted to have drawn him in to have
married her, that she might have deceived him, and
enjoyed the Thoughts of her own Superiority for
Life. As I remember, he never asks her fairly to
marry him but once, and then she consents: But
how different in every Action is she from the sly and
artful Woman, who would have snatched at this Opportunity,
and not have trusted him with a Moment's
Delay, whilst <i>Clarissa</i>, being then ill, consents, with a
Confidence that nothing but her Goodness and Simplicity
could have had in such a Man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Tho' <i>Clarissa</i> unfortunately met with <i>Lovelace</i>,
yet I can imagine her with a Lover whose honest
Heart, assimulating with hers, would have given her
leave, as she herself wishes, to have shewn the Frankness
of her Disposition, and to have openly avowed her
Love. But <i>Lovelace</i>, by his own intriguing Spirit,
made her Reserves, and then complained of them;
and as she was engaged with such a Man, I think
the Catastrophe's being what is called <i>Unhappy</i>, is
but the natural Consequence of such an Engagement;
tho', I confess, I was not displeased that the Report
of this Catastrophe met with so many Objections, as it
proved what an Impression the Author's favourite
Character had made on those Minds which could not
bear she should fall a Sacrifice to the Barbarity of her
Persecutors. And I hope that now all the Readers
of <i>Clarissa</i> are convinced how rightly the Author has
judged in this Point. If the Story was not to have ended
tragically, the grand Moral would have been lost, as
well as that grand Picture, if I may call it so, of human
Life, of a Man's giving up every thing that is valuable,
only because every thing that is valuable is
in his Power. <i>Lovelace</i> thought of the Substance,
whilst that was yet to be persued; but once within
reach of it, his plotting Head and roving Imagination
would let him see only the Shadow, and once
enter'd into the Pursuit, his Pride, the predominant
Passion of his Soul, engaged him to fly after a visionary
Gratification which his own wild Fancy had painted,
till, like one following an <i>Ignis fatuus</i> through By-Paths
and crooked Roads, he lost himself in the
Eagerness of his own Pursuit, and involved with him
the innocent <i>Clarissa</i>, who, persecuted, misunderstood,
envied, and evil-treated as she had been, by
those from whom she had most Reason to hope Protection,
I think could not find a better Close to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Misfortunes than a triumphant Death. Triumphant
it may very well be called, when her Soul, fortified
by a truly Christian Philosophy, melted and
softened in the School of Affliction, had conquered
every earthly Desire, baffled every uneasy Passion,
lost every disturbing Fear, while nothing remained
in her tender Bosom but a lively Hope of future
Happiness. When her very Griefs were in
a manner forgot, the Impression of them as faint and
languid as a feverish Dream to one restored to Health,
all calm and serene her Mind, forgiving and praying
for her worst Enemies, she retired from all her
Afflictions, to meet the Reward of her Christian
Piety.</p>

<p>The Death of <i>Clarissa</i> is, I believe, the only Death
of the Kind in any Story; and in her Character, the
Author has thrown into Action (if I may be allowed
the Expression) the true Christian Philosophy,
shewn its Force to ennoble the human Mind,
till it can look with Serenity on all human Misfortunes,
and take from Death itself its gloomy
Horrors. Never was any thing more judicious than
the Author's bringing <i>Lovelace</i> as near as <i>Knight's-Bridge</i>
at the Time of <i>Clarissa's</i> Death; for by that
means he has in a manner contrived to place in one
View before our Eyes the guilty Ravager of unprotected
Innocence, the boasting Vaunter of his own
useless Parts, in all the Horrors of mad Despair,
whilst the injured Innocent, in a pious, in a
divine Frame of Mind is peaceably breathing her
last. 'Such a Smile! such a charming Serenity (says
Mr. <i>Belford</i>) overspreading her sweet Face at the
Instant, as seemed to manifest her eternal Happiness
already begun.'</p>

<p>Surely the Tears we shed for <i>Clarissa</i> in her last
Hours, must be Tears of tender Joy! Whilst we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
seem to live, and daily converse with her through
her last Stage, our Hearts are at once rejoiced and
amended, are both soften'd and elevated, till our
Sensations grow too strong for any Vent, but that
of Tears; nor am I ashamed to confess, that Tears
without Number have I shed, whilst Mr. <i>Belford</i>
by his Relation has kept me (as I may say)
with fixed Attention in her Apartment, and made
me perfectly present at her noble exalted Behaviour;
nor can I hardly refrain from crying out, 'Farewell,
my dear <i>Clarissa</i>! may every Friend I love in
this World imitate you in their Lives, and thus
joyfully quit all the Cares and Troubles that disturb
this mortal Being!'</p>

<p>May <i>Clarissa's</i> Memory be as triumphant as was
her Death! May all the World, like <i>Lovelace</i>, bear
Testimony to her Virtues, and acknowledge her Triumph!</p>

<p>I am with many Thanks, Sir, for your obliging
Letter,</p>
